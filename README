Project 2--Clock

In this program, we prompt the user to enter six commands. The commands are a, c, q, r, s, 
and t. Each command preforms different task to program. Command "a" increase the initial 
second by one. Command c lets the user set the current time. Command "q" will exit the 
program. Command "r" resets the time to its initial time 00:00:00. Command "s" lets the 
user set the time. Command "t" switches the from 24-hour clock to 12-hour clock, or vice-
versa. You are first prompt to enter a command, depending on which command you select, it 
will preform that task and continue asking you to input a command until the command q is 
inputed into the program, which will exit your program. The initial time for the program 
00:00:00. The program will accept your input either uppercase or lowercase.
